# **Ms Devine Lake** #
***
>## **Project Overview** ##

Ms Devine Lake is an up and coming drag act with so much more to offer.\
This site hopes to highlight these attributes and sell her as a performer, host, comedian, \
and also sell the man behind the lashes, as James himself is a trained actor and singer \
with many years experience to share....for the right price.\
As well as showcasing the talent, this site is very much about making contact, with the end result \
being booked for paid work.

>## **Credits** ###

### **-Content** ###

All text is my own words except the biography which is loosely based on two friends \
biographys from theatre programmes found on the show websites, (Phantom and Les Mis), \
which I have then altered to create a new piece.

### **-Media** ###

All photographs are taken from the Pexels website, and are by a photographer called cottonbro.

### **-Acknowledgements** ###

The inspiration for this project came from a friend who is a performer and drag queen, but \
is unfortunately unable to work due to the current situation. He is hoping to take advantage of this project \
when things turn around and he is able to offer his creative services.
Credit also needs to go to the tutors at The Code Institute, Igor, Kevin and Sheryl, my Mentor Aaron Sinnott \
my parents for the constant flow of tea and my little cat Jessica for keeping me calm.
