# **Ms Devine Lake** #

>## **Project Overview** ##

Ms Devine Lake is an up and coming drag act with so much more to offer.\
This site hopes to highlight these attributes and sell her as a performer, host, comedian, \
and also sell the man behind the lashes, as James himself is a trained actor and singer \
with many years experience to share....for the right price.\
As well as showcasing the talent, this site is very much about making contact, with the end result \
being booked for paid work.

>## **Testing** ##

## **First Time Visitor Goals** ##

1. As a first time visitor, I want to see who this performer is and what they do.

+ On first loading the site, the user is greeted with a ‘Welcome’ and an image of Ms Devine Lake. She is surrounded\
by reviews that not only rate her as a performer, but also show what she can do for prospective employers.

2. As a first time visitor, I want to easily find information on the performer.

+ A first time user of the site has the option of the standard dropdown menu to easily navigate the various pages.\
The more obscure navigation links bring more of a performance to the site and hopefully a more memorable experience\
once the link between the words and their relevant pages is realised.

3. As a first time visitor, I want to find other ways to view the performer.

+ As well as seeing the images of previous performances by navigating to the gallery page, links to social media sites\
can be found at the at the bottom of each page to open up new pages of information on Ms Devine Lake.


## **Returning Visitor Goals** ##

1. As a returning visitor, I want to see new performance images.

+ To keep the site fresh, the gallery page is easily updated with any new image to keep visitors coming back.

2. As a returning visitor, I want to learn more about the performer.

+ A first visit will be due to interest in Ms Devine Lake. However, the user is also able to access information on the performer behind the character, which is easily found via the various navigation links to the Biography and social media links at the bottom of each page.

3. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to make contact to discuss bookings.

+ By now, the user will hopefully know the contact page can be found by clicking Thirst or alternatively by using the dropdown menu. This page has the contact form which will not send until it’s filled in correctly. There are also the links at the bottom of the page to make contact in other ways.


## **Frequent Visitor Goals** ##

1. As a frequent visitor, I want to read updated reviews.

+ The welcome page is easily updated with reviews as and when they are available.

2. As a frequent visitor, I want to see what the performer is doing now and what the next project might be.

+ The biography page is easily added to, so a user can find any new projects that the performer may be working on.

3. As a frequent visitor, I want to see if any new services are offered.

+ The contact page is easily updated to include new services offered with the contact form accessible to take enquires further.

## **Further Testing** ##

+ On all pages, the order of content changes depending on size of device its viewed on.
+ Smaller devices have information pushed to the top for more effect.
+ On larger devices, the dropdown under the star has two versions for asthetic reasons while on smaller \
devices, only one star dropdown is visible.
+ On the Home page, an extra image is displayed on the medium size device for better spacing.
+ On the Contact page, the image used is as seen and not cut off badly, as it is the only page for \
services from Ms Devine Lake and James, both being the same person.

A potential bug I found was that the Instagram link did not work at all. I fixed this be deleting the\
Instagram app from my chromebook. On the deployed site I have found that this link works fine on a mobile device \
that also has instagram installed. A reason for this issue was never found.

>## **Credits** ###

### **Content** ###

All text written by the developer except the biography, which is loosely based on two \
biographys from theatre programmes found on the show websites, (Phantom and Les Mis), \
which I have then altered to create a new piece.

### **Media** ###

All photographs are taken from the Pexels website, and are by a photographer called cottonbro.

### **Acknowledgements** ###

The inspiration for this project came from a friend who is a performer and drag queen, but \
unfortunately unable to work due to the current situation. He is hoping to take advantage of this project \
when things turn around and he is able to offer his creative services.
Credit also needs to go to the tutors at The Code Institute, my Mentor Aaron Sinnott \
my parents for the constant flow of tea and my little cat Jessica for keeping me calm.
