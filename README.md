# **Ms Devine Lake** #
***
>## **Project Overview** ##

Ms Devine Lake is an up and coming drag act with so much more to offer.\
This site hopes to highlight these attributes and sell her as a performer, host, comedian, \
and also sell the man behind the lashes, as James himself is a trained actor and singer \
with many years experience to share....for the right price.\
As well as showcasing the talent, this site is very much about making contact, with the end result \
being booked for paid work.

>## **Technologies Used** ##

To create this site I have used,\
GitPod <https://www.gitpod.io/> and GitHub <https://github.com/> were used to create, host, store and \
eventually deploy the project.\
Bootstrap <https://getbootstrap.com/> was used for resposive elements of the site, the title icons \
and various other fearures such as dropdown menus and a contact form.\
Fontawesome <https://fontawesome.com/> was used for the majority of the icons used throughout the site\
Google fonts <https://fonts.google.com/> was used to style the font, RocknRoll One, which runs throughout the site,\
with a sans serif as the backup.\
Pexels <https://www.pexels.com/> was used for all the images throughout the site\
W3C <https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator> and W3C <https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input> were used \
for testing purposes along with Lighthouse in developer tools
<https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html> and <https://www.freeformatter.com/css-beautifier.html> were used \
to format and beautify html and css.

>## **Testing** ##

On each page, every link to there corresponding pages works, that includes the navigation bars, \
both dropdown menus and the social media links.\
The contact form displays error messages when the email field and the message field are left black \
and an error message appears when the @ symbol is not present in the email field.\
I have run the code including css through W3C validators and checkers and no errors have occured.\

On all pages, the order of content changes depending on size of device its viewed on.\
Smaller devices have information pushed to the top for more effect.\
On larger devices, the dropdown under the star has two versions for asthetic reasons while on smaller \
devices, only one star dropdown is visible.
On the Desire/Home page, an extra image is displayed on the medium size device for better spacing.\
On the Thirst/Contact page, the image used is as seen and not cut off badly, as it is the only page for \
services from Ms Devine Lake and James, both being the same person.

A potential bug I found was that the Instagram link did not work at all. I fixed this be deleting the\
Instagram app from my chromebook. On the deployed site I have found that this link works fine on a mobile device \
that also has instagram installed. A reason for this issue was never found.

>## **Credits** ###

### **-Content** ###

All text is my own words except the biography which is loosely based on two friends \
biographys from theatre programmes found on the show websites, (Phantom and Les Mis), \
which I have then altered to create a new piece.

### **-Media** ###

All photographs are taken from the Pexels website, and are by a photographer called cottonbro.

### **-Acknowledgements** ###

The inspiration for this project came from a friend who is a performer and drag queen, but \
is unfortunately unable to work due to the current situation. He is hoping to take advantage of this project \
when things turn around and he is able to offer his creative services.
Credit also needs to go to the tutors at The Code Institute, Igor, Kevin and Sheryl, my Mentor Aaron Sinnott \
my parents for the constant flow of tea and my little cat Jessica for keeping me calm.
